# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to build models that predict passenger survival.

## Overview

Using Python and machine learning libraries, I explored the data, engineered features, and trained classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The goal was to maximize prediction accuracy and understand key factors affecting survival.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Evaluation (ROC AUC, Accuracy)
